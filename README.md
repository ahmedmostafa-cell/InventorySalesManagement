# Inventory and Sales Management System

## Project Overview
This is a simple web-based inventory and sales management system built using **ASP.NET Core MVC, jQuery, and AJAX**. The system provides user authentication, product management (CRUD operations), and a sales invoice module with real-time calculations.

## Features
### 1. User Authentication (Login Screen)
- Users can log in using their username and password.
- Authentication and session management using **ASP.NET Core Identity**.
- AJAX-based login validation (no full-page reload).
- Redirects users to the dashboard upon successful login.

### 2. Product Management (CRUD Operations)
- Add, update, delete, and display products.
- Required fields:
  - **Product Name** (Text input)
  - **Price** (Numeric input)
  - **Stock Quantity** (Numeric input)
  - **Product Type** (Radio buttons: Ù…Ø®Ø²Ù†ÙŠ - Stored, Ø®Ø¯Ù…ÙŠ - Service)
  - **Category Group** (Dropdown with predefined categories)
- Soft delete functionality.
- DataTable integration for displaying products with sorting and filtering.
- All operations performed via **AJAX for a seamless experience**.

### 3. Sales Invoice Module
- Create sales invoices with:
  - **Product Selection** (Dropdown: Choose from available products)
  - **Quantity** (Numeric input)
  - **Price** (Auto-filled from product details)
  - **Total Price** (Auto-calculated: Quantity Ã— Price)
- Users can dynamically add multiple products via AJAX.
- Summary table showing added products and total price.
- Real-time invoice calculation.
- Saves invoices to the database and maintains a history table.

## Technologies Used
### **Back-end:**
- **ASP.NET Core MVC** (Latest Stable Version)
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** for database operations
- **SQL Server** as the database
- **Dependency Injection** for maintainability
- **Repository Pattern** (optional, recommended for scalability)

### **Front-end:**
- **jQuery & AJAX** for async data operations
- **Bootstrap** for responsive design
- **DataTables** for sorting and filtering records

### **Security Features:**
- **User Authentication & Authorization**
- **CSRF Protection** (Anti-forgery tokens used in AJAX requests)
- **Input Validation** to prevent SQL Injection and XSS
- **Secure AJAX requests** using anti-forgery tokens

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites:
- .NET SDK (Latest stable version)
- SQL Server
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code (Recommended)
